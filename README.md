A git plugin to shift your commits out of work hours.

__Or at least it will be.__ Currently this command just prints "Hello, World."

Of _course_ you're a responsible developer, and you never work on your own stuff during working hours. You _never_ get that craving to just throw something together late on a Friday afternoon.
But imagine you _did_ - you couldn't publish your git repo, because you committed during working hours!

`git workout` ... now your commits are shifted to after 6pm, and you're free to push to your public repo of choice,
without your boss ever finding out.
